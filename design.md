- **Text**: Light Gray (#e2e8f0) - High contrast for readability
- **Success**: Traffic Green (#10b981) - Free flow conditions
- **Warning**: Traffic Amber (#f59e0b) - Moderate congestion
- **Error**: Traffic Red (#ef4444) - Heavy congestion and incidents
- **Critical**: Deep Purple (#8b5cf6) - Standstill conditions

### Typography
- **Display Font**: "Inter" - Clean, modern sans-serif for headings and data
- **Monospace**: "JetBrains Mono" - For road codes, coordinates, and technical data
- **Body Text**: "Inter" - Consistent typography throughout interface
- **Font Sizes**: Large headings (2.5rem), medium subheadings (1.5rem), small body text (0.875rem) for high-resolution displays

### Visual Language
- **Transportation-Inspired**: Drawing from intelligent transportation systems and traffic management interfaces
